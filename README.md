# CryptaBox Wallet ‚Äî Proof of Concept (PoC)
[DEMO](https://cryptabox.github.io/cryptabox-demo/) || HOME PAGE: https://cryptabox.com/ 
---
CryptaBox is a browser-based cryptocurrency wallet designed with a strong emphasis on **security**, **anonymity**, and **client-side key generation**. This repository contains a **working prototype (PoC)** to demonstrate the wallet's internal logic and transparent architecture.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This PoC allows you to:

* Generate a cold wallet (client-side, no server storage)
* Create keys and addresses for BTC, ETH, LTC, and DOGE
* Build and sign transactions (BTC-like and ETH)
* Encode addresses as QR codes
* View lightweight charts using real price data

All functionality is executed on the **client side**, without centralized APIs or databases.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main demo file (UI + generation test)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qrencode.html           # Supporting QR encoder interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css               # Core styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /jslibs                 # Third-party libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /jsbox                  # Custom scripts (wallet engine, TX builder)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download as ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Your keys are generated in-browser.
4. Use developer tools to inspect logic and verify security.

> Note: Internet access is required only for fetching charts (unless adapted to offline). Key generation is fully offline.

## üîí Security & Privacy

* Private keys are generated client-side using `Crypto.getRandomValues()`
* No keys, addresses, or transactions are sent to any server by default
* QR generation and scanning are local (browser-based)
* You **must** audit all scripts before using in production

---

## üß™ Proof of Concept Disclaimer

This repository is provided as a **demonstration** for educational, research, and transparency purposes.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use with real funds unless you understand all security implications.**
* API keys and full node endpoints are removed. You must provide your own.
* Scripts may need adaptation to your node provider's API.
* This is **not a complete production wallet** ‚Äî but a PoC showcasing secure key handling and offline logic.

---

## üß∞ Recommendations for Developers

* Review and validate entropy sources used in key generation.
* Customize request logic for your backend / node provider.
* Replace "Your API Key" placeholders and test accordingly.
* You can fork and adapt this as a backendless wallet interface.

## üìú License

* CoinJS is BSD licensed
* Other third-party scripts have permissive licenses (see respective headers)
* Your custom code can be licensed under MIT or another license as you prefer
